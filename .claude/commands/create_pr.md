# Create Pull Request

Automate the complete PR workflow: version bump, changelog update, commit, and PR creation.

## Instructions

1. **Get the current branch name** by running `git branch --show-current`
   - If on `main` or `master`, stop and warn the user

2. **Check for uncommitted changes**:
   - Run `git status --porcelain` to check for any unstaged or uncommitted changes
   - If there are uncommitted changes, commit them in reasonable, logical groups:
     - Review the changes with `git diff` and `git diff --cached`
     - Group related changes together (e.g., all changes for one feature)
     - Create meaningful commit messages following conventional commit format
     - Use `git add` selectively for each logical group
     - Create commits with proper messages including Claude Code footer
   - If no uncommitted changes, proceed to next step

3. **Analyze changes** on this branch vs `main`:
   - Run `git log main..HEAD --oneline --no-merges`
   - Run `git diff main --stat`
   - Determine appropriate version bump (patch/minor/major)

4. **Read current CHANGELOG.md** to understand format and current version

5. **Ask user for version bump type** if not obvious:
   - Use AskUserQuestion tool to confirm patch/minor/major
   - Provide context about what changed to help them decide

6. **Bump the version**:
   - Run `yarn version:patch`, `yarn version:minor`, or `yarn version:major` based on decision
   - This updates package.json

7. **Update CHANGELOG.md**:
   - Read the updated package.json to get the new version number
   - Add new changelog entry with today's date (YYYY-MM-DD format)
   - Group changes by type (Added, Changed, Fixed, Removed)
   - Write clear, concise descriptions

8. **Commit the version bump and changelog**:
   - Add CHANGELOG.md and package.json
   - Create commit with message: `chore: prepare release v{version}`
   - Include Claude Code footer

9. **Push to remote**:
   - Run `git push -u origin {branch-name}`

10. **Generate PR markdown**:

- Create a markdown-formatted PR title and body
- Title format: `chore: {brief summary of changes}`
- Body should include:
  - Summary section with bullet points of changes
  - Test plan checklist
  - Claude Code footer
- Generate the GitHub PR creation URL in format:
  `https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/compare/main...{branch-name}`

11. **Output the PR information** to the user:

- Display the PR title
- Display the PR body in a code block
- Provide the GitHub URL link to create the PR manually
- Instruct user to click the link, paste the body, and submit

## Example PR Body Format

```markdown
## Summary

- Added new feature X
- Fixed bug in Y component
